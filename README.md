# dummy-blog
A dummy blog built with Flask to demonstrate utilizing a relational database to hold users, blog posts and comments.

# What I learned
* CRUD Relational Databasing (sqlite3 for development, Postgres for prod)
* Backend development with Flask
* Login management (have to log in to comment on posts)
* Admin Privileged accounts (only admins can add/delete new posts)
